                            We are currently living in an unsustainable consumption cycle. While babies
                            grow extraordinarily fast, products don’t grow with them. Parents spend an
                            average of $12,000 every year on baby products that kids outgrow within
                            weeks. This cycle leads to enormous amounts of waste for our planet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But the problem is not just on the consumer side. Every time you buy a
                            product and you return it, companies have to get rid of those
                            returned items due to high inventory costs. Even if the item was never
                            used and the packaging is undamaged, the vast majority of returned products
                            become waste.
